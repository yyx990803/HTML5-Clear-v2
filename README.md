# WORK IN PROGRESS

See it in action [here](http://clear.evanyou.me).

## What is this?

This is a remake of the [original HTML5 Clear](https://raw.github.com/yyx990803/HTML5-Clear).

The original iphone app by Realmac: [http://www.realmacsoftware.com/clear/](http://www.realmacsoftware.com/clear/)


## What's New?

- Local storage
- More robust structure
- More robust touch events handling
- More features such as long drag up/down
- Multitouch (WIP)

## Why do it again?

When I made the original HTML5 Clear, I simply wanted to build something shiny in a short time. The vimeo video covered up most of the bugs, unstableness and dirtiness underneath. It also missed quite some beautiful details of the original iOS app.

So for this version, by adding a lot more visual/motion details and multi-touch gestures, the purpose is mostly challenging my own technical limits. Besides, I really enjoy having something I can slowly polish without having to worry about deadlines.
